# Encrypted-Chat-Room
A program where a user can connect to a server in the terminal send a message and all other people in the chatroom will be displayed that message as well as send messages.

potentially using Python and AES for encrypting the messages in transfer.

I imagine program will have two files one for the server to listen and bradcast messages and the user to do the same but on the user side.

1. Create a simple connection between a server and a user.
2. Make `ping` and `pong` to ensure messages can be sent and received.
3. Make the connections be able to be logged into by many users.
4. Functionality fo the users to send messages.
5. Encrypt messages in traffic.
6. Dockerize?
